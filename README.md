1. Summarizer Task
Used PDF libraries to load doc. Using 10k tokens in a chunk. Using chucks in Map Reduce which is a technique in langchain. Apparently its better than stuffing and easier to implement than refining. It will give me small summaries of small chunks which I can then combine

Summaries are generated like:
    Summary #0
    Summary #1...



2. Prompt Engineering Task

For this task, I chose gpt-4 model for higher accuracy, a temp of 1.0 to make it factual and no limit on the number of output tokens. My approach here was defining a prompt template that I had tested on Playground first. The prompt works perfectly. Next was the task of automating it. Since the link I was given was empty, I generated some dummy data using chatGPT and added it in a JSON format 'student.json'. By iterating through the json document in my code, I extracted and changed the prompt placeholders with the required field. The outputs were consistent and thorough. 


The outputs generated using the students.json file is:

    Study plan for  Sara Kim
    1. Sara Kim is a fourth year psychology student who is mainly pursuing subjects such as Cognitive Psychology, Social Psychology, Statistics, and Research Methods. Sara has an auditory and reading/writing type of learning style. Her objectives are to complete a thesis on cognitive biases and to secure an internship in a clinical setting.

    2. One of Sara's extracurricular activities is the Psychology Student Association, which directly aligns with her field of study as it can provide her a platform to gain practical experience and valuable connections. Her participation in the Yoga Club, while not directly related to her study, can aid in managing stress and achieving a well-rounded college experience.

    3. Sara should ideally reserve 3-4 hours daily concentrating on her academic work. Time can be balanced across her subjects dedicating: 2 hours for Cognitive and Social Psychology and 1-2 hours for Statistics and Research Methods, depending on the extensive work involved in the course. However, she should spend additional hours when working on her thesis. Sara should allot at least 3-4 hours per week for her extracurricular activities.

    4. Sara can improve by taking advantage of her preferred learning styles and incorporating more audio books and written exercises into her study routine. She can also seek out opportunities within her club activities that can serve her career interests, such as pursuing leadership roles or organizing relevant events. Sara should also actively seek for internship opportunities in clinical settings. Lastly, maintaining a balanced lifestyle with adequate time for relaxation and other activities will be beneficial for Sara's overall achievements.



    Study plan for  David Martinez
    1. David Martinez is a first-year student studying Business Administration. His subjects this year include Principles of Management, Accounting, Economics, and Marketing. David identifies his preferred learning styles as reading/writing and visual.
