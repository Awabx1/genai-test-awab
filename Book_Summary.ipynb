Subscribe to our free eBooks blog and email newsletter.Crime and PunishmentBy Fyodor Dostoevsky Crime and Punishment \\x18Translator’s PrefaceA few words about Dostoevsky himself may help the Eng -lish reader to understand his work.Dostoevsky was the son of a doctor. His parents were very hard- working and deeply religious people, but so poor that they lived with their five children in only two rooms. The father and mother spent their evenings in reading aloud to their children, generally from books of a serious charac -ter.Though always sickly and delicate Dostoevsky came out third in the final examination of the Petersburg school of Engineering. There he had already begun his first work, ‘Poor Folk.’This story was published by the poet Nekrassov in his review and was received with acclamations. The shy, un -known youth found himself instantly something of a celebrity. A brilliant and successful career seemed to open before him, but those hopes were soon dashed. In 1849 he was arrested.Though neither by temperament nor conviction a revolu -tionist, Dostoevsky was one of a little group of young men who met together to read Fourier and Proudhon. He was ac -cused of ‘taking part in conversations against the censorship, of reading a letter from Byelinsky to Gogol, and of knowing of the intention to set up a printing press.’ Under Nicholas I.  \\x18 Free eBooks at Planet eBook.com(that ‘stern and just man,’ as Maurice Baring calls him) this was enough, and he was condemned to death. After eight months’ imprisonment he was with twenty-one others tak -en out to the Semyonovsky Square to be shot. Writing to his brother Mihail, Dostoevsky says: ‘They snapped words over our heads, and they made us put on the white shirts worn by persons condemned to death. Thereupon we were bound in threes to stakes, to suffer execution. Being the third in the row, I concluded I had only a few minutes of life before me. I thought of you and your dear ones and I contrived to kiss Plestcheiev and Dourov, who were next to me, and to bid them farewell. Suddenly the troops beat a tattoo, we were unbound, brought back upon the scaffold, and informed that his Majesty had spared us our lives.’ The sentence was commuted to hard labour.One of the prisoners, Grigoryev, went mad as soon as he was untied, and never regained his sanity.The intense suffering of this experience left a lasting stamp on Dostoevsky’s mind. Though his religious temper led him in the end to accept every suffering with resignation and to regard it as a blessing in his own case, he constantly recurs to the subject in his writings. He describes the awful agony of the condemned man and insists on the cruelty of inflicting such torture. Then followed four years of penal servitude, spent in the company of common criminals in Siberia, where he began the ‘Dead House,’ and some years of service in a disciplinary battalion.He had shown signs of some obscure nervous disease be -fore his arrest and this now developed into violent attacks of  Crime and Punishment \\x18epilepsy, from which he suffered for the rest of his life. The fits occurred three or four times a year and were more fre -quent in periods of great strain. In 1859 he was allowed to return to Russia. He started a journal— ‘Vremya,’ which was forbidden by the Censorship through a misunderstanding. In 1864 he lost his first wife and his brother Mihail. He was in terrible poverty, yet he took upon himself the payment of his brother’s debts. He started another journal—‘The Ep -och,’ which within a few months was also prohibited. He was weighed down by debt, his brother’s family was depen -dent on him, he was forced to write at heart-breaking speed, and is said never to have corrected his work. The later years of his life were much softened by the tenderness and devo -tion of his second wife.In June 1880 he made his famous speech at the unveil -ing of the monument to Pushkin in Moscow and he was received with extraordinary demonstrations of love and honour.A few months later Dostoevsky died. He was followed to the grave by a vast multitude of mourners, who ‘gave the hapless man the funeral of a king.’ He is still probably the most widely read writer in Russia.In the words of a Russian critic, who seeks to explain the feeling inspired by Dostoevsky: ‘He was one of ourselves, a man of our blood and our bone, but one who has suffered and has seen so much more deeply than we have his insight impresses us as wisdom … that wisdom of the heart which we seek that we may learn from it how to live. All his other gifts came to him from nature, this he won for himself and  \\x18 Free eBooks at Planet eBook.comthrough it he became great.’ Crime and Punishment \\x18Part I \\x18 Free eBooks at Planet eBook.comChapter IOn an exceptionally hot evening early in July a young man came out of the garret in which he lodged in S. Place and walked slowly, as though in hesitation, towards K. bridge.He had successfully avoided meeting his landlady on the staircase. His garret was under the roof of a high, five-sto -ried house and was more like a cupboard than a room. The landlady who provided him with garret, dinners, and at -tendance, lived on the floor below, and every time he went out he was obliged to pass her kitchen, the door of which invariably stood open. And each time he passed, the young man had a sick, frightened feeling, which made him scowl and feel ashamed. He was hopelessly in debt to his landlady, and was afraid of meeting her.This was not because he was cowardly and abject, quite the contrary; but for some time past he had been in an over -strained irritable condition, verging on hypochondria. He had become so completely absorbed in himself, and iso -lated from his fellows that he dreaded meeting, not only his landlady, but anyone at all. He was crushed by poverty, but the anxieties of his position had of late ceased to weigh upon him. He had given up attending to matters of practi -cal importance; he had lost all desire to do so. Nothing that any landlady could do had a real terror for him. But to be  Crime and Punishment \\x18stopped on the stairs, to be forced to listen to her trivial, ir -relevant gossip, to pestering demands for payment, threats and complaints, and to rack his brains for excuses, to pre -varicate, to lie—no, rather than that, he would creep down the stairs like a cat and slip out unseen.This evening, however, on coming out into the street, he became acutely aware of his fears.‘I want to attempt a thing like that  and am frightened by these trifles,’ he thought, with an odd smile. ‘Hm … yes, all is in a man’s hands and he lets it all slip from cowardice, that’s an axiom. It would be interesting to know what it is men are most afraid of. Taking a new step, uttering a new word is what they fear most…. But I am talking too much. It’s because I chatter that I do nothing. Or perhaps it is that I chatter because I do nothing. I’ve learned to chatter this last month, lying for days together in my den thinking … of Jack the Giant-killer. Why am I going there now? Am I capable of that? Is that serious? It is not serious at all. It’s simply a fantasy to amuse myself; a plaything! Yes, maybe it is a plaything.’The heat in the street was terrible: and the airlessness, the bustle and the plaster, scaffolding, bricks, and dust all about him, and that special Petersburg stench, so familiar to all who are unable to get out of town in summer—all worked painfully upon the young man’s already overwrought nerves. The insufferable stench from the pot- houses, which are particularly numerous in that part of the town, and the drunken men whom he met continually, although it was a working day, completed the revolting misery of the picture.  \\x18 Free eBooks at Planet eBook.comAn expression of the profoundest disgust gleamed for a mo -ment in the young man’s refined face. He was, by the way, exceptionally handsome, above the average in height, slim, well-built, with beautiful dark eyes and dark brown hair. Soon he sank into deep thought, or more accurately speak -ing into a complete blankness of mind; he walked along not observing what was about him and not caring to observe it. From time to time, he would mutter something, from the habit of talking to himself, to which he had just confessed. At these moments he would become conscious that his ideas were sometimes in a tangle and that he was very weak; for two days he had scarcely tasted food.He was so badly dressed that even a man accustomed to shabbiness would have been ashamed to be seen in the street in such rags. In that quarter of the town, however, scarce -ly any shortcoming in dress would have created surprise. Owing to the proximity of the Hay Market, the number of establishments of bad character, the preponderance of the trading and working class population crowded in these streets and alleys in the heart of Petersburg, types so vari -ous were to be seen in the streets that no figure, however queer, would have caused surprise. But there was such accu -mulated bitterness and contempt in the young man’s heart, that, in spite of all the fastidiousness of youth, he minded his rags least of all in the street. It was a different matter when he met with acquaintances or with former fellow stu -dents, whom, indeed, he disliked meeting at any time. And yet when a drunken man who, for some unknown reason, was being taken somewhere in a huge waggon dragged by a  Crime and Punishment 10heavy dray horse, suddenly shouted at him as he drove past: ‘Hey there, German hatter’ bawling at the top of his voice and pointing at him—the young man stopped suddenly and clutched tremulously at his hat.

But there was such accu -mulated bitterness and contempt in the young man’s heart, that, in spite of all the fastidiousness of youth, he minded his rags least of all in the street. It was a different matter when he met with acquaintances or with former fellow stu -dents, whom, indeed, he disliked meeting at any time. And yet when a drunken man who, for some unknown reason, was being taken somewhere in a huge waggon dragged by a  Crime and Punishment 10heavy dray horse, suddenly shouted at him as he drove past: ‘Hey there, German hatter’ bawling at the top of his voice and pointing at him—the young man stopped suddenly and clutched tremulously at his hat. It was a tall round hat from Zimmerman’s, but completely worn out, rusty with age, all torn and bespattered, brimless and bent on one side in a most unseemly fashion. Not shame, however, but quite another feeling akin to terror had overtaken him.‘I knew it,’ he muttered in confusion, ‘I thought so! That’s the worst of all! Why, a stupid thing like this, the most trivial detail might spoil the whole plan. Yes, my hat is too notice -able…. It looks absurd and that makes it noticeable…. With my rags I ought to wear a cap, any sort of old pancake, but not this grotesque thing. Nobody wears such a hat, it would be noticed a mile off, it would be remembered…. What mat -ters is that people would remember it, and that would give them a clue. For this business one should be as little con -spicuous as possible…. Trifles, trifles are what matter! Why, it’s just such trifles that always ruin everything….’He had not far to go; he knew indeed how many steps it was from the gate of his lodging house: exactly seven hundred and thirty. He had counted them once when he had been lost in dreams. At the time he had put no faith in those dreams and was only tantalising himself by their hideous but daring recklessness. Now, a month later, he had begun to look upon them differently, and, in spite of the monologues in which he jeered at his own impotence and indecision, he had involuntarily come to regard this ‘hid -eous’ dream as an exploit to be attempted, although he still  11 Free eBooks at Planet eBook.comdid not realise this himself. He was positively going now for a ‘rehearsal’ of his project, and at every step his excitement grew more and more violent.With a sinking heart and a nervous tremor, he went up to a huge house which on one side looked on to the canal, and on the other into the street. This house was let out in tiny tenements and was inhabited by working people of all kinds—tailors, locksmiths, cooks, Germans of sorts, girls picking up a living as best they could, petty clerks, etc. There was a continual coming and going through the two gates and in the two courtyards of the house. Three or four door-keepers were employed on the building. The young man was very glad to meet none of them, and at once slipped un -noticed through the door on the right, and up the staircase. It was a back staircase, dark and narrow, but he was familiar with it already, and knew his way, and he liked all these sur -roundings: in such darkness even the most inquisitive eyes were not to be dreaded.‘If I am so scared now, what would it be if it somehow came to pass that I were really going to do it?’ he could not help asking himself as he reached the fourth storey. There his progress was barred by some porters who were engaged in moving furniture out of a flat. He knew that the flat had been occupied by a German clerk in the civil service, and his family. This German was moving out then, and so the fourth floor on this staircase would be untenanted except by the old woman. ‘That’s a good thing anyway,’ he thought to himself, as he rang the bell of the old woman’s flat. The bell gave a faint tinkle as though it were made of tin and not of  Crime and Punishment 1\\x18copper. The little flats in such houses always have bells that ring like that. He had forgotten the note of that bell, and now its peculiar tinkle seemed to remind him of something and to bring it clearly before him…. He started, his nerves were terribly overstrained by now. In a little while, the door was opened a tiny crack: the old woman eyed her visitor with evident distrust through the crack, and nothing could be seen but her little eyes, glittering in the darkness. But, seeing a number of people on the landing, she grew bolder, and opened the door wide. The young man stepped into the dark entry, which was partitioned off from the tiny kitch -en. The old woman stood facing him in silence and looking inquiringly at him. She was a diminutive, withered up old woman of sixty, with sharp malignant eyes and a sharp lit -tle nose. Her colourless, somewhat grizzled hair was thickly smeared with oil, and she wore no kerchief over it. Round her thin long neck, which looked like a hen’s leg, was knot -ted some sort of flannel rag, and, in spite of the heat, there hung flapping on her shoulders, a mangy fur cape, yellow with age. The old woman coughed and groaned at every in -stant. The young man must have looked at her with a rather peculiar expression, for a gleam of mistrust came into her eyes again.‘Raskolnikov, a student, I came here a month ago,’ the young man made haste to mutter, with a half bow, remem -bering that he ought to be more polite.‘I remember, my good sir, I remember quite well your coming here,’ the old woman said distinctly, still keeping her inquiring eyes on his face. 1\\x18 Free eBooks at Planet eBook.com‘And here … I am again on the same errand,’ Raskol -nikov continued, a little disconcerted and surprised at the old woman’s mistrust. ‘Perhaps she is always like that though, only I did not notice it the other time,’ he thought with an uneasy feeling.The old woman paused, as though hesitating; then stepped on one side, and pointing to the door of the room, she said, letting her visitor pass in front of her:‘Step in, my good sir.’The little room into which the young man walked, with yellow paper on the walls, geraniums and muslin curtains in the windows, was brightly lighted up at that moment by the setting sun.‘So the sun will shine like this then  too!’ flashed as it were by chance through Raskolnikov’s mind, and with a rapid glance he scanned everything in the room, trying as far as possible to notice and remember its arrangement. But there was nothing special in the room. The furniture, all very old and of yellow wood, consisted of a sofa with a huge bent wooden back, an oval table in front of the sofa, a dressing-table with a looking-glass fixed on it between the windows, chairs along the walls and two or three half-penny prints in yellow frames, representing German damsels with birds in their hands—that was all. In the corner a light was burning before a small ikon. Everything was very clean; the floor and the furniture were brightly polished; everything shone.‘Lizaveta’s work,’ thought the young man. There was not a speck of dust to be seen in the whole flat.‘It’s in the houses of spiteful old widows that one finds  Crime and Punishment 1\\x18such cleanliness,’ Raskolnikov thought again, and he stole a curious glance at the cotton curtain over the door leading into another tiny room, in which stood the old woman’s bed and chest of drawers and into which he had never looked before. These two rooms made up the whole flat.‘What do you want?’ the old woman said severely, com -ing into the room and, as before, standing in front of him so as to look him straight in the face.‘I’ve brought something to pawn here,’ and he drew out of his pocket an old-fashioned flat silver watch, on the back of which was engraved a globe; the chain was of steel.‘But the time is up for your last pledge. The month was up the day before yesterday.’‘I will bring you the interest for another month; wait a little.’‘But that’s for me to do as I please, my good sir, to wait or to sell your pledge at once.’‘How much will you give me for the watch, Alyona Iva -novna?’‘You come with such trifles, my good sir, it’s scarcely worth anything. I gave you two roubles last time for your ring and one could buy it quite new at a jeweler’s for a rou -ble and a half.’‘Give me four roubles for it, I shall redeem it, it was my father’s. I shall be getting some money soon.’‘A rouble and a half, and interest in advance, if you like!’‘A rouble and a half!’ cried the young man.‘Please yourself’—and the old woman handed him back the watch. The young man took it, and was so angry that he  1\\x18 Free eBooks at Planet eBook.comwas on the point of going away; but checked himself at once, remembering that there was nowhere else he could go, and that he had had another object also in coming.‘Hand it over,’ he said roughly.The old woman fumbled in her pocket for her keys, and disappeared behind the curtain into the other room. The young man, left standing alone in the middle of the room, listened inquisitively, thinking. He could hear her unlock -ing the chest of drawers.‘It must be the top drawer,’ he reflected. ‘So she carries the keys in a pocket on the right. All in one bunch on a steel ring…. And there’s one key there, three times as big as all the others, with deep notches; that can’t be the key of the chest of drawers … then there must be some other chest or strong-box … that’s worth knowing. Strong-boxes always have keys like that … but how degrading it all is.’The old woman came back.‘Here, sir: as we say ten copecks the rouble a month, so I must take fifteen copecks from a rouble and a half for the month in advance.

So I must give you a rouble and fifteen copecks for the watch. Here it is.’‘What! only a rouble and fifteen copecks now!’‘Just so.’The young man did not dispute it and took the money. He looked at the old woman, and was in no hurry to get away, as though there was still something he wanted to say  Crime and Punishment 1\\x18or to do, but he did not himself quite know what.‘I may be bringing you something else in a day or two, Alyona Ivanovna —a valuable thing—silver—a cigarette-box, as soon as I get it back from a friend …’ he broke off in confusion.‘Well, we will talk about it then, sir.’‘Good-bye—are you always at home alone, your sister is not here with you?’ He asked her as casually as possible as he went out into the passage.‘What business is she of yours, my good sir?’‘Oh, nothing particular, I simply asked. You are too quick…. Good-day, Alyona Ivanovna.’Raskolnikov went out in complete confusion. This con -fusion became more and more intense. As he went down the stairs, he even stopped short, two or three times, as though suddenly struck by some thought. When he was in the street he cried out, ‘Oh, God, how loathsome it all is! and can I, can I possibly…. No, it’s nonsense, it’s rubbish!’ he added resolutely. ‘And how could such an atrocious thing come into my head? What filthy things my heart is capable of. Yes, filthy above all, disgusting, loathsome, loathsome!—and for a whole month I’ve been….’ But no words, no exclamations, could express his agitation. The feeling of intense repulsion, which had begun to oppress and torture his heart while he was on his way to the old woman, had by now reached such a pitch and had taken such a definite form that he did not know what to do with himself to escape from his wretched -ness. He walked along the pavement like a drunken man, regardless of the passers-by, and jostling against them, and  1\\x18 Free eBooks at Planet eBook.comonly came to his senses when he was in the next street. Look -ing round, he noticed that he was standing close to a tavern which was entered by steps leading from the pavement to the basement. At that instant two drunken men came out at the door, and abusing and supporting one another, they mounted the steps. Without stopping to think, Raskolnikov went down the steps at once. Till that moment he had never been into a tavern, but now he felt giddy and was tormented by a burning thirst. He longed for a drink of cold beer, and attributed his sudden weakness to the want of food. He sat down at a sticky little table in a dark and dirty corner; or -dered some beer, and eagerly drank off the first glassful. At once he felt easier; and his thoughts became clear.‘All that’s nonsense,’ he said hopefully, ‘and there is noth -ing in it all to worry about! It’s simply physical derangement. Just a glass of beer, a piece of dry bread—and in one mo -ment the brain is stronger, the mind is clearer and the will is firm! Phew, how utterly petty it all is!’But in spite of this scornful reflection, he was by now looking cheerful as though he were suddenly set free from a terrible burden: and he gazed round in a friendly way at the people in the room. But even at that moment he had a dim foreboding that this happier frame of mind was also not normal.There were few people at the time in the tavern. Besides the two drunken men he had met on the steps, a group con -sisting of about five men and a girl with a concertina had gone out at the same time. Their departure left the room quiet and rather empty. The persons still in the tavern were  Crime and Punishment 1\\x18a man who appeared to be an artisan, drunk, but not ex -tremely so, sitting before a pot of beer, and his companion, a huge, stout man with a grey beard, in a short full-skirted coat. He was very drunk: and had dropped asleep on the bench; every now and then, he began as though in his sleep, cracking his fingers, with his arms wide apart and the up -per part of his body bounding about on the bench, while he hummed some meaningless refrain, trying to recall some such lines as these:‘His wife a year he fondly loved His wife a—a year he—fondly loved.’Or suddenly waking up again:‘Walking along the crowded row He met the one he used to know.’But no one shared his enjoyment: his silent compan -ion looked with positive hostility and mistrust at all these manifestations. There was another man in the room who looked somewhat like a retired government clerk. He was sitting apart, now and then sipping from his pot and look -ing round at the company. He, too, appeared to be in some agitation. 1\\x18 Free eBooks at Planet eBook.comChapter IIRaskolnikov was not used to crowds, and, as we said be -fore, he avoided society of every sort, more especially of late. But now all at once he felt a desire to be with other people. Something new seemed to be taking place within him, and with it he felt a sort of thirst for company. He was so weary after a whole month of concentrated wretchedness and gloomy excitement that he longed to rest, if only for a moment, in some other world, whatever it might be; and, in spite of the filthiness of the surroundings, he was glad now to stay in the tavern.The master of the establishment was in another room, but he frequently came down some steps into the main room, his jaunty, tarred boots with red turn-over tops coming into view each time before the rest of his person. He wore a full coat and a horribly greasy black satin waistcoat, with no cravat, and his whole face seemed smeared with oil like an iron lock. At the counter stood a boy of about fourteen, and there was another boy somewhat younger who handed whatever was wanted. On the counter lay some sliced cu -cumber, some pieces of dried black bread, and some fish, chopped up small, all smelling very bad. It was insufferably close, and so heavy with the fumes of spirits that five min -utes in such an atmosphere might well make a man drunk.There are chance meetings with strangers that interest  Crime and Punishment \\x180us from the first moment, before a word is spoken. Such was the impression made on Raskolnikov by the person sit -ting a little distance from him, who looked like a retired clerk. The young man often recalled this impression af -terwards, and even ascribed it to presentiment. He looked repeatedly at the clerk, partly no doubt because the latter was staring persistently at him, obviously anxious to enter into conversation. At the other persons in the room, includ -ing the tavern- keeper, the clerk looked as though he were used to their company, and weary of it, showing a shade of condescending contempt for them as persons of station and culture inferior to his own, with whom it would be useless for him to converse. He was a man over fifty, bald and griz -zled, of medium height, and stoutly built. His face, bloated from continual drinking, was of a yellow, even greenish, tinge, with swollen eyelids out of which keen reddish eyes gleamed like little chinks. But there was something very strange in him; there was a light in his eyes as though of intense feeling—perhaps there were even thought and intel -ligence, but at the same time there was a gleam of something like madness. He was wearing an old and hopelessly ragged black dress coat, with all its buttons missing except one, and that one he had buttoned, evidently clinging to this last trace of respectability. A crumpled shirt front, covered with spots and stains, protruded from his canvas waistcoat. Like a clerk, he wore no beard, nor moustache, but had been so long unshaven that his chin looked like a stiff greyish brush. And there was something respectable and like an of -ficial about his manner too. But he was restless; he ruffled  \\x181 Free eBooks at Planet eBook.comup his hair and from time to time let his head drop into his hands dejectedly resting his ragged elbows on the stained and sticky table. At last he looked straight at Raskolnikov, and said loudly and resolutely:‘May I venture, honoured sir, to engage you in polite con -versation? Forasmuch as, though your exterior would not command respect, my experience admonishes me that you are a man of education and not accustomed to drinking.

Forasmuch as, though your exterior would not command respect, my experience admonishes me that you are a man of education and not accustomed to drinking.

In spite of the mo -mentary desire he had just been feeling for company of any sort, on being actually spoken to he felt immediately his habitual irritable and uneasy aversion for any stranger who approached or attempted to approach him.‘A student then, or formerly a student,’ cried the clerk. ‘Just what I thought! I’m a man of experience, immense ex -perience, sir,’ and he tapped his forehead with his fingers in self-approval. ‘You’ve been a student or have attended some learned institution! … But allow me….’ He got up, staggered, took up his jug and glass, and sat down beside the young man, facing him a little sideways. He was drunk, but spoke fluently and boldly, only occasionally losing the thread of his sentences and drawling his words. He pounced upon Raskolnikov as greedily as though he too had not spo - Crime and Punishment \\x18\\x18ken to a soul for a month.‘Honoured sir,’ he began almost with solemnity, ‘poverty is not a vice, that’s a true saying. Yet I know too that drunk -enness is not a virtue, and that that’s even truer. But beggary, honoured sir, beggary is a vice. In poverty you may still re -tain your innate nobility of soul, but in beggary—never—no one. For beggary a man is not chased out of human society with a stick, he is swept out with a broom, so as to make it as humiliating as possible; and quite right, too, forasmuch as in beggary I am ready to be the first to humiliate myself. Hence the pot-house! Honoured sir, a month ago Mr. Le -beziatnikov gave my wife a beating, and my wife is a very different matter from me! Do you understand? Allow me to ask you another question out of simple curiosity: have you ever spent a night on a hay barge, on the Neva?’‘No, I have not happened to,’ answered Raskolnikov. ‘What do you mean?’‘Well, I’ve just come from one and it’s the fifth night I’ve slept so….’ He filled his glass, emptied it and paused. Bits of hay were in fact clinging to his clothes and sticking to his hair. It seemed quite probable that he had not undressed or washed for the last five days. His hands, particularly, were filthy. They were fat and red, with black nails.His conversation seemed to excite a general though lan -guid interest. The boys at the counter fell to sniggering. The innkeeper came down from the upper room, apparently on purpose to listen to the ‘funny fellow’ and sat down at a little distance, yawning lazily, but with dignity. Evidently Marmeladov was a familiar figure here, and he had most  \\x18\\x18 Free eBooks at Planet eBook.comlikely acquired his weakness for high-flown speeches from the habit of frequently entering into conversation with strangers of all sorts in the tavern. This habit develops into a necessity in some drunkards, and especially in those who are looked after sharply and kept in order at home. Hence in the company of other drinkers they try to justify them -selves and even if possible obtain consideration.‘Funny fellow!’ pronounced the innkeeper. ‘And why don’t you work, why aren’t you at your duty, if you are in the service?’‘Why am I not at my duty, honoured sir,’ Marmeladov went on, addressing himself exclusively to Raskolnikov, as though it had been he who put that question to him. ‘Why am I not at my duty? Does not my heart ache to think what a useless worm I am? A month ago when Mr. Lebeziatnikov beat my wife with his own hands, and I lay drunk, didn’t I suffer? Excuse me, young man, has it ever happened to you … hm … well, to petition hopelessly for a loan?’‘Yes, it has. But what do you mean by hopelessly?’‘Hopelessly in the fullest sense, when you know before -hand that you will get nothing by it. You know, for instance, beforehand with positive certainty that this man, this most reputable and exemplary citizen, will on no consideration give you money; and indeed I ask you why should he? For he knows of course that I shan’t pay it back. From compas -sion? But Mr. Lebeziatnikov who keeps up with modern ideas explained the other day that compassion is forbidden nowadays by science itself, and that that’s what is done now in England, where there is political economy. Why, I ask  Crime and Punishment \\x18\\x18you, should he give it to me? And yet though I know before -hand that he won’t, I set off to him and …’‘Why do you go?’ put in Raskolnikov.‘Well, when one has no one, nowhere else one can go! For every man must have somewhere to go. Since there are times when one absolutely must go somewhere! When my own daughter first went out with a yellow ticket, then I had to go … (for my daughter has a yellow passport),’ he add -ed in parenthesis, looking with a certain uneasiness at the young man. ‘No matter, sir, no matter!’ he went on hurried -ly and with apparent composure when both the boys at the counter guffawed and even the innkeeper smiled—‘No mat -ter, I am not confounded by the wagging of their heads; for everyone knows everything about it already, and all that is secret is made open. And I accept it all, not with contempt, but with humility. So be it! So be it! ‘Behold the man!’ Ex -cuse me, young man, can you…. No, to put it more strongly and more distinctly; not can you but dare  you, looking upon me, assert that I am not a pig?’The young man did not answer a word.‘Well,’ the orator began again stolidly and with even in -creased dignity, after waiting for the laughter in the room to subside. ‘Well, so be it, I am a pig, but she is a lady! I have the semblance of a beast, but Katerina Ivanovna, my spouse, is a person of education and an officer’s daughter. Granted, granted, I am a scoundrel, but she is a woman of a noble heart, full of sentiments, refined by education. And yet … oh, if only she felt for me! Honoured sir, honoured sir, you know every man ought to have at least one place where  \\x18\\x18 Free eBooks at Planet eBook.compeople feel for him! But Katerina Ivanovna, though she is magnanimous, she is unjust…. And yet, although I realise that when she pulls my hair she only does it out of pity—for I repeat without being ashamed, she pulls my hair, young man,’ he declared with redoubled dignity, hearing the snig -gering again—‘but, my God, if she would but once…. But no, no! It’s all in vain and it’s no use talking! No use talk -ing! For more than once, my wish did come true and more than once she has felt for me but … such is my fate and I am a beast by nature!’‘Rather!’ assented the innkeeper yawning. Marmeladov struck his fist resolutely on the table.‘Such is my fate! Do you know, sir, do you know, I have sold her very stockings for drink? Not her shoes—that would be more or less in the order of things, but her stock -ings, her stockings I have sold for drink! Her mohair shawl I sold for drink, a present to her long ago, her own property, not mine; and we live in a cold room and she caught cold this winter and has begun coughing and spitting blood too. We have three little children and Katerina Ivanovna is at work from morning till night; she is scrubbing and cleaning and washing the children, for she’s been used to cleanliness from a child. But her chest is weak and she has a tendency to consumption and I feel it! Do you suppose I don’t feel it? And the more I drink the more I feel it. That’s why I drink too. I try to find sympathy and feeling in drink…. I drink so that I may suffer twice as much!’ And as though in despair he laid his head down on the table.‘Young man,’ he went on, raising his head again, ‘in your  Crime and Punishment \\x18\\x18face I seem to read some trouble of mind. When you came in I read it, and that was why I addressed you at once. For in unfolding to you the story of my life, I do not wish to make myself a laughing-stock before these idle listeners, who indeed know all about it already, but I am looking for a man of feeling and education. Know then that my wife was educated in a high-class school for the daughters of noble -men, and on leaving she danced the shawl dance before the governor and other personages for which she was presented with a gold medal and a certificate of merit. The medal … well, the medal of course was sold—long ago, hm … but the certificate of merit is in her trunk still and not long ago she showed it to our landlady. And although she is most con -tinually on bad terms with the landlady, yet she wanted to tell someone or other of her past honours and of the happy days that are gone. I don’t condemn her for it, I don’t blame her, for the one thing left her is recollection of the past, and all the rest is dust and ashes. Yes, yes, she is a lady of spirit, proud and determined. She scrubs the floors herself and has nothing but black bread to eat, but won’t allow herself to be treated with disrespect. That’s why she would not overlook Mr. Lebeziatnikov’s rudeness to her, and so when he gave her a beating for it, she took to her bed more from the hurt to her feelings than from the blows. She was a widow when I married her, with three children, one smaller than the other. She married her first husband, an infantry officer, for love, and ran away with him from her father’s house. She was') - Preview: The passage describes a scene in a tavern where a disheveled and drunk man, Marmeladov, engages in conversation with Raskolnikov, a young student.

            "```The passage provides an introduction to Fyodor Dostoevsky's background and his novel \"Crime and Punishment.\" Dostoevsky, the son of a doctor, grew up in poverty with his deeply religious parents and siblings in a two-room dwelling. Despite being sickly, he excelled academically, finishing third in his class at the Petersburg School of Engineering and writing his first work, \"Poor Folk.\" His early promise was disrupted when he was arrested in 1849 for engaging in anti-censorship discussions and knowing of plans to establish a printing press. He was sentenced to death but was reprieved at the last moment and sentenced to hard labor in Siberia. There, he experienced profound suffering, which deeply influenced his writings, often focusing on the psychological torment of his characters.\n",
            "\n",
            "The passage then shifts to the novel's opening scene, which takes place on a stiflingly hot evening in early July in Saint Petersburg. A young man emerges from his attic room, which is more like a closet than a living space, and descends the staircase, avoiding his landlady to whom he owes rent. The young man is described as being in a state of heightened irritability and hypochondria, choosing to isolate himself and feeling a deep sense of dread about interacting with anyone, particularly his landlady, whose demands for rent he cannot fulfill. He is aware of his own poverty and has given up on managing practical affairs.\n",
            "\n",
            "As he walks through the streets, he is overwhelmed by the heat, dust, and foul smells of the city, and the sights of drunks and disorderly houses in his neighborhood. Despite his shabby appearance, which is typical for the area, he feels a sense of disgust and contempt. He is lost in his thoughts, talking to himself and acknowledging his mental confusion and physical weakness brought on by not having eaten properly for two days.\n",
            "\n",
            "The young man is acutely self-conscious, especially when recognized by acquaintances or fellow students; however, he is less bothered by strangers noticing his worn-out clothing. A sudden shout from a drunk man causes him to react with insecurity, clutching his hat—a dilapidated piece from Zimmerman's. This reaction hints at his complex feelings about his social status and personal dignity amidst his destitution.\n",
            "In this passage, the narrator describes the crowded, bustling streets of a working-class area in the heart of Petersburg, where the young protagonist feels out of place and self-conscious due to his ragged appearance. Despite his disdain for his worn clothes, he is particularly troubled by his conspicuous hat, fearing it will make him stand out and jeopardize a certain plan he has in mind. The young man, who we learn is named Raskolnikov, is walking to a specific location while counting the exact number of steps from his lodging house, indicating his meticulous and obsessive nature.\n",
            "\n",
            "Raskolnikov arrives at a large house divided into small apartments inhabited by various working-class individuals. He avoids the attention of the doorkeepers and takes a familiar, dark back staircase to avoid being noticed. His anxiety is palpable, as he is on the way to \"rehearse\" an ominous project that he has been contemplating for a month, which he initially dismissed as a reckless dream but now seems to take more seriously.\n",
            "\n",
            "Upon reaching the fourth floor, he is relieved to find that a family that lived there is moving out, leaving the floor mostly vacant except for the flat of an old woman. He rings the bell to her apartment, which reminds him of something he can't quite place, and is greeted with suspicion. The old woman, described as withered and sharp-eyed, eventually recognizes Raskolnikov as a student who visited a month prior. She lets him into her meticulously clean flat, which he scans quickly, noting its basic furnishings and layout.\n",
            "\n",
            "Raskolnikov has come to pawn an old silver watch but is disappointed by the low price the old woman offers him. After some haggling, she agrees to take the watch for a rouble and a half plus advance interest. While she retrieves the money, Raskolnikov takes note of her keys and the probable existence of a strong-box, reflecting on the degrading nature of his task. The old woman returns, deducts the interest from the loan amount, and completes the transaction with Raskolnikov, who has other, undisclosed motives for his visit.\n",
            "In this passage from \"Crime and Punishment,\" the young man, who is later revealed as Raskolnikov, is in the apartment of an old woman, Alyona Ivanovna, to whom he has come with an ulterior motive beyond the apparent one. He watches her carefully as she retrieves something from a chest of drawers, noting the details of the keys she uses and pondering the existence of a strong-box. He receives a small sum of money for a pawned item but seems reluctant to leave, hinting he may return with another item to pawn. He inquires subtly about Alyona Ivanovna's living situation, particularly about her sister, before exiting.\n",
            "\n",
            "Outside, Raskolnikov is consumed by confusion and a sense of disgust with himself, questioning the morality of the thoughts he's been entertaining. He feels an intense repulsion that overwhelms him, causing him to walk erratically through the streets. In an attempt to alleviate his distress, he enters a tavern for the first time, seeking out the company of others and something to drink. He quickly consumes a beer, which brings him momentary relief and clarity, convincing him that his prior worries are trivial.\n",
            "\n",
            "The tavern is not very crowded and Raskolnikov observes the few patrons present, including a couple of drunk men, and most notably, a man who looks like a retired government clerk. This man, Marmeladov, intrigues Raskolnikov and seems to want to initiate a conversation with him. Despite his initial resistance to interaction, Raskolnikov feels drawn to the company of others and decides to stay in the tavern. Marmeladov, who is in a state of dishevelment and appears to have been drinking heavily, eventually addresses Raskolnikov directly with a mix of formality and desperation, introducing himself and inquiring about Raskolnikov's background. The passage ends before Raskolnikov's response.\n",
            "The passage describes a scene in a tavern where a disheveled and drunk man, Marmeladov, engages in conversation with Raskolnikov, a young student. Marmeladov, with a grandiose and somewhat self-pitying manner, introduces himself as a titular counsellor and probes Raskolnikov about his background, correctly guessing that he is a student. Despite Raskolnikov's initial reluctance to interact, Marmeladov is persistent. He speaks with a mix of drunken fluency and confusion, admitting to his own poverty and vice of drunkenness. He distinguishes between poverty, which can still allow for nobility of spirit, and beggary, which he sees as degrading and shameful.\n",
            "\n",
            "Marmeladov recounts a recent humiliation where a man named Lebeziatnikov beat his wife, and despite the pain and shame it caused him, he was too drunk to intervene. He reveals his desperate attempts to borrow money, knowing full well that it's a hopeless endeavor, as he is unlikely to ever repay it. Marmeladov's outpourings seem to be a regular occurrence, as indicated by the reactions of the tavern's staff and patrons, who find him amusing.\n",
            "\n",
            "Marmeladov then delves into his personal life, describing his wife, Katerina Ivanovna, as a noble and educated woman from a respectable background. He laments his own failings and mistakes, including selling his wife's possessions for drink. Marmeladov is aware of his wife's deteriorating health and feels guilt for contributing to her misery, yet he continues to drink as a way to seek sympathy and to intensify his own suffering.\n",
            "\n",
            "He recognizes a kindred sense of trouble in Raskolnikov and seeks someone educated and empathetic to listen to his story, not to be mocked by the tavern crowd. He speaks of his wife's past honors, her education, and her pride despite their current destitution. Marmeladov details the physical and emotional abuse his wife has endured, including the disrespect from Lebeziatnikov that led to a physical altercation. He finishes by reflecting on his wife's past, including her first marriage to an infantry officer and her strong-willed nature, which persists despite their hardships.```\n",
